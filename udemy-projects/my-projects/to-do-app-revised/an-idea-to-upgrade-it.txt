edit button which copies the values of items/cards, could be done with ngOnChanges()
puts them into the input fields,
replaces the buttons with (click)="onUpdate()"
the method replaces the values and empties input fields, again use ngOnChanges maybe,
then hides the update button and shows the normal ones
